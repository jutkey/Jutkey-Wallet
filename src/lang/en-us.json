The Guard Node (Miner Node) is an important loop among these 4 kinds of nodes in the Jutkey Wallet network, and it is also an optional condition for becoming a member of the Jutkey Wallet Foundation Council. If you increase the amount of staked Jutkey Wallet System Token (IBXC), the corresponding Mining Power will be increased. At the same time, if you increase the duration of staked IBXC for mining, your Mining Power will also be increased.</h4> <div class='i_mb20'>Miners are calculated based on capacity, so the Guard Node (Miner Node) not only bears the security of the Jutkey Wallet Blockchain Network, but also serves as the data storage of various applications in the network, as well as the storage function of Gfiles (a distributed dile storage system) and other storage functions based on Jutkey Wallet, so increasing your storage capacity will increase your Mining Computer Power.</div>",
