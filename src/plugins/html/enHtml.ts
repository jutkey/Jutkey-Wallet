In the event of the foregoing, when the    assets have entered your or your transaction counterparty’s Jutkey Wallet or    third-party wallet, you understand that blockchain operations are    irreversible and the related transaction is irrevocable and this is you and    your transaction counterparty who bears the corresponding risks and    consequences.  </section>  <section>    5.3 When you deal with third parties integrated into Jutkey Wallet, for your    own benefit, Jutkey Wallet recommends you to read this Agreement carefully,    especially the transaction object and product information.

Otherwise, you will bear    all the losses and expenses arising therefrom.  </section>  <section>    5.6 Please note that after you create or import a wallet in Jutkey Wallet,    your login password, transaction password, private key, and mnemonic words    are stored only in the current device and not on the Jutkey Wallet server.    <strong class="bolder">      Therefore, Jutkey Wallet does not have users’ mnemonic words, cannot      overrule the wallet asset management of the User, and cannot retrieve the      mnemonic words for the User.  </strong>You can refer to the Help Center to change      your mobile device using wallet synchronization provided by Jutkey Wallet.      <strong class="bolder">   However, if you do not save or backup your wallet password, private key,      mnemonic words etc. and your mobile device gets lost, your digital assets      will be lost, too.
